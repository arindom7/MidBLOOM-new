                <p>e-NAM is a pan-India electronic trading portal launched on 14th April 2016 to integrate APMC mandis into a unified online market under the "One Nation One Market" initiative. Implemented by SFAC under the Ministry of Agriculture, it enables online bidding, e-payment, and AI-based quality assessment for farmers and traders.</p>
                <p><strong>Subsidy:</strong> The e-NAM scheme provides grants of up to ₹30 lakh per mandi for infrastructure development to support online trading, but it does not offer direct subsidies to farmers. Some state governments may provide additional support, such as subsidies for smartphones and internet access, to encourage farmer participation.</p>

                <p>The National Agriculture Insurance Scheme (NAIS) was introduced by the Government of India to provide comprehensive insurance coverage and financial support to farmers against crop losses due to natural calamities, pests, and diseases. The scheme promotes the stability of farm incomes and encourages farmers to adopt modern agricultural practices.</p>
                <p><strong>Subsidy:</strong> The National Agricultural Insurance Scheme (NAIS) provided 50% premium subsidy for small and marginal farmers, covering food, oilseed, and commercial crops against natural calamities. It was later replaced by Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) in 2016 for better coverage.</p>
